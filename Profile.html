            <p class="intro-Jimin">Park Ji-min, better known mononymously as Jimin, is a South Korean singer,
                songwriter, and dancer. In 2013, he debuted as a member of the South Korean boy band BTS, under the
                record label Big Hit
                Entertainment.His immediate family includes his mother, father, and a younger brother. When he was a
                child, he attended Busan's Hodong Elementary School and Yonsan Middle School. During middle school,
                he attended Just Dance Academy and learned popping and locking dance.[citation needed] Prior to becoming
                a trainee, Jimin studied contemporary dance at Busan High School of Arts and was a top student in the
                modern dance department.After a teacher suggested he audition with an entertainment company, it led
                him to Big Hit Entertainment. Once he passed the auditions in 2012, he transferred to Korean Arts High
                School, graduating in 2014. Jimin graduated from Global Cyber University in August 2020, with a major in
                Broadcasting and
                Entertainment. As of 2021, he is enrolled at Hanyang Cyber University, pursuing a Master of Business
                Administration in Advertising and Media.</p>

    <h1>Career</h1>
    <div class="Profile">
        <img src="Images/Jimin.jpg" alt="Park Jimin" class="career-img" />
        <p class="about-career">On June 13, 2013, Jimin made his debut as a member of BTS with the release of the single
            "No More Dream". In the group, Jimin holds the position of vocalist and dancer. Under BTS, he has
            released three solo songs: "Lie", "Serendipity", and "Filter". "Lie" was released in 2016, as part of the
            group's second Korean studio album, Wings. It was described as stunning and dramatic, conveying dark
            undertones and emotions that helped reflect the overall concept of the album. In contrast, "Serendipity",
            released on the Love Yourself: Her (2017) extended play (EP), was soft and sensual, unraveling the joy,
            conviction, and curiosity of love. "Filter", from the group's 2020 studio album, Map of the Soul: 7, was
            very different from its predecessor, with a distinct Latin pop-esque flair and lyrics that reflected on the
            different sides of himself that Jimin shows to the world and those around him."Serendipity" and "Lie" both
            surpassed fifty million streams on Spotify in 2018, followed shortly thereafter by the former's full length
            version from BTS' Love Yourself: Answer (2018) compilation album, which achieved the milestone in early
            2019. With this, Jimin set a new record as the only Korean artist to have three solo tracks accumulate over
            50 million streams each—previously Psy was the only Korean artist to ever cross the 50 million streams mark
            with "Gangnam Style" (2012) and "Gentleman" (2013). Both songs were also the only solos by a BTS
            member included in the Official Chart Company's list of the top 20 most streamed BTS songs in the United
            Kingdom as of October 2018, ranking at number 17 and 19 respectively.[14] In April 2019, the list was
            expanded to reflect the top 40, and both tracks ranked at numbers 18 and 20 respectively, the highest of
            five solo songs included that year.</p>

        <p class="about-achievement">In May 2019, Jimin became the first BTS member to have a solo music video achieve
            100 million views on YouTube with "Serendipity". It was the nineteenth BTS music video overall to achieve
            the milestone. He was the only BTS member with multiple solo songs in the January 2020 update of the
            Official Chart's top 40 list. "Lie" and "Serendipity" were the second and third most-streamed solos at
            numbers 24 and 29, behind only "Euphoria" by Jungkook at number 19. "Serendipity"'s full length version
            debuted at number 38, behind "Intro: Boy Meets Evil" by J-Hope at number 35 but ahead of "Trivia: Seesaw" by
            Suga at number 39. In February, "Filter" set a record for the biggest streaming debut among all Korean
            songs on Spotify with over 2.2 million streams in its first 24 hours of release, and went on to become the
            fastest Korean solo in the platform's history to surpass 20–60 million streams. It is also the first
            and only solo BTS b-side track to receive a Song of The Year nomination at the Gaon Chart Music
            Awards. In March 2021, it became BTS' 15th song to spend a full year on Billboard's World Digital
            Song Sales chart. "Filter" is the longest-charting Korean song released in 2020, and has spent 74 weeks
            on the ranking as of the August 28, 2021 issue.Jimin was awarded the fifth-class Hwagwan Order of Cultural
            Merit in 2018 by the President of South Korea, Moon Jae-in, along with other members of BTS for their
            contributions to the promotion of Korean culture. In July 2021, President Moon appointed him Special
            Presidential Envoy for Future Generations and Culture, along with the other members of BTS, to help "lead
            the global agenda for future generations, such as sustainable growth" and "expand South Korea's diplomatic
            efforts and global standing" in the international community.</p>

        <p class="about-phil">From 2016 to 2018, Jimin supported graduates of Busan Hodong Elementary School, his alma
            mater, by covering uniform expenses. After news of the school's closing was released, he donated summer and
            winter middle school uniforms to the final graduates and gifted autographed albums to the entire student
            body. In early 2019, Jimin donated KRW₩100 million (approximately US$88,000 at the time) to the Busan
            Department of Education to help support lower income students. Of the total, ₩30 million (approximately
            $23,000) went to his alma mater, Busan Arts High School. In July 2020, he donated another ₩100 million,
            this time to the Jeonnam Future Education Foundation, for the creation of a scholarship fund for talented
            but financially struggling students from South Jeolla Province. In July 2021, Jimin donated ₩100 million
            to Rotary International, to help polio patients. As with previous donations, the benefaction was made
            privately, but the news became public in September, when the Go-seong Rotary Club displayed a banner
            thanking him for the donation. On October 12, 2021, Jimin was announced as a member of the Green Noble
            Club. The club is made of large donors who've made donations of ₩100 million or more to the Green Umbrella
            Children's Foundation.</p>
